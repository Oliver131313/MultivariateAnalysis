# Introduction
The goal of this document is to show how LDA can be used to classify FIFA 22 player's positions.
FIFA 22 is a popular football simulator. This game is enjoyed by milions of people and player's abilities in the simulator are documented pretty accurately.  


We reduce the classification with LDA technique only to a binary classification because it is easier for illustration and easier to interpret. Additionally we use two different approaches:

1. We transform the data with Factor Analysis and then use LDA for classification
2. We only standardize the data and then run LDA

After this we compare models with multiples techniques to show which performs better.



# 1. Data exploration and dimensionality reduction
## 1.1. Data loading and preprocessing

Clear workspace and load libraries
```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(MASS)
library(psych)
library(ggbiplot)
```

**Data Source:**  [link](www.kaggle.com/bryanb/fifa-player-stats-database/version/27?select=FIFA22_official_data.csv)
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Import data
raw_data <- read_delim("FIFA22_official_data.csv")
```
How many unique roles/positions are in the dataset?
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
length(unique(raw_data$`Best Position`))
```
***
**Preprocess the data**


* we have 15 unique positions - We'd like to make that number smaller becuase many positions are very similar
* We can divide them into following categories:
    * Center Forward
    * Center Midfielder
    * Right Midfielder/Winger
    * Left Midfielder/Winger
    * Right Back
    * Left Back
    * Central Back (defender)
    * Goalkeeper

```{r}
data <- raw_data %>%
    # Reduction of positions
    dplyr::mutate(
        BestPos = factor(
            case_when(
                `Best Position` %in% c("CF", "ST") ~ "CF/ST",
                `Best Position`  %in% c("CAM", "CM", "CDM") ~ "CM/CAM/CDM",
                `Best Position` %in% c("RW", "RM") ~ "RW/RM",
                `Best Position` %in% c("LW", "LM") ~ "LW/RM",
                `Best Position` %in% c("RWB", "RB") ~ "RWB/RB",
                `Best Position` %in% c("LWB", "LB") ~ "LWB/LB",
                `Best Position` %in% c("CB") ~ "CB",
                `Best Position` %in% c("GK") ~ "GK"
            )
        ),
        Height = as.double(str_replace(Height, 'cm', '')),
        Weight = as.double(str_replace(Weight, 'kg', '')),
        PrefFoot = as.factor(`Preferred Foot`),
        WeekFoot = `Weak Foot`,
        SkillMoves = `Skill Moves`,
        WorkRate = as.factor(`Work Rate`),
        BodyType = factor(`Body Type`)
    ) %>%
    # Picking only relevant columns
    dplyr::select(
        Name,
        BestPos,
        Age,
        PrefFoot,
        WeekFoot,
        SkillMoves,
        WorkRate,
        BodyType,
        Height,
        Weight,
        Crossing,
        Finishing,
        HeadingAccuracy,
        ShortPassing,
        Volleys,
        Dribbling,
        Curve,
        FKAccuracy,
        LongPassing,
        BallControl,
        Acceleration,
        SprintSpeed,
        Agility,
        Reactions,
        Stamina,
        Interceptions,
        Balance,
        Strength,
        Positioning,
        ShotPower,
        LongShots,
        Vision,
        StandingTackle,
        Jumping,
        Aggression,
        Penalties,
        SlidingTackle
    ) 
```


**Choice of 2 positions to predict:**


* To make the prediction even simpler, we will predict only Centre Forwards and Central Midfielders
    * These two categories should be quite different and we expect LDA to perform well
* To make the prediction simpler, we use only numeric variables, thus we exclude categorical columns

```{r}
fifa <- data %>%
    filter(BestPos %in% c("CM/CAM/CDM", "CF/ST")) %>%
    # Ponechame si vsak iba numericke stlpce
    select_if(!(map(., class) %in% c("factor", "character")))

# Number of NA values
str_glue('{round(sum(is.na(fifa)) / dim(fifa)[1] * 100, 2)} %')

```


Only 3% of rows contain missing values - we can drop those

```{r, include=FALSE}
fifa <- fifa %>%
    na.omit()
# Contorl check of missing values
sum(is.na(fifa))
```
***

## 1.2. PCA
In next step, we perform PCA to see whether it can, keep substantional amount of variance in first three Principal Components. The number 3 comes from the knowledge of the columns. They could be roughly divided into 3 categories: Offensive, Defensive and Physical attributes.

```{r}
# Fit PCA on standardized and centered data
fit <- prcomp(fifa, center = T, scale. = T)
# Show results
sum_pca <- summary(fit) 
sum_pca
```

If we were to reduce the dimensionality, we would be probably satisfied with 75% variance retained (5 PCs).
But let's make a **Scree Plot**

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cum_var_pca <-
    as.vector(sort(sum_pca$importance[2, 1:10], decreasing = TRUE))
plot(cum_var_pca, type = "l", 
     xlab = "Principal Components", ylab = "Proportion of Variance",)
axis(1, at=seq(1, 10), labels = as.character(seq(1, 10)))
title("Scree Plot")
```


* Biplot isn't very helpful in this case

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Biplot skrz ggplot
ggbiplot(
    fit,
    scale = 1,
    circle = TRUE,
    var.scale = 1,
    var.axes = TRUE,
    alpha = 0
)
```

***
## 1.3 FA
Next we perform Factor Analysis. We know approximately how much factors we should have and we can represent players/positions with smaller number of columns. Even EA Sports (FIFA 22 producers) summarizes the different players with fewer attributes. They show you their radar plots in the game. It can be useful to determine which player to play at the positions, as there are more options usually.
We wanna reduce the number of dimensions only to k=3 because we don't need more and assume no or only small lost of information.  
We can see in the diagram that FA dimension reduction produces what we'd expect. We can name the dimensions (approximately) as following:


* Offensive abilities (ML2)
* Defensive abilities (ML1)
* Physical attributes (ML3)

In the diagram below, we can see that the attributes fit into the categories as we'd expect.  

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
fa <-
    fa(
        r = fifa,
        nfactors = 3,
        rotate = "varimax",
        fm = "ml",
        scores = "regression",
        residuals = T
    )

fa.diagram(fa.results = fa)
```


Below, we can see absolute values of loadings

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fa.loads <- as_tibble(unclass(fa$loadings))
fa.loads$Variable <- rownames(unclass(fa$loadings))
fa.loads <- fa.loads  %>%
    mutate(ML2 = abs(ML2),
           ML1 = abs(ML1),
           ML3 = abs(ML3))

fa.l.m <- reshape2::melt(
    fa.loads,
    id = "Variable",
    measure = c("ML2", "ML1", "ML3"),
    variable.name = "Factor",
    value.name = "Loading"
)


fa.l.m <- fa.l.m %>% arrange(desc(Loading))

ggplot(fa.l.m, aes(Variable, abs(Loading), fill = Loading)) +
    facet_wrap( ~ Factor, nrow = 1) + #place the factors in separate facets
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + #make the bars
    coord_flip() + #flip the axes so the test names can be horizontal
    #define the fill color gradient: blue=positive, red=negative
    scale_fill_gradient2(
        name = "Loading",
        high = "blue",
        mid = "white",
        low = "red",
        midpoint = 0,
        guide = F
    ) +
    ylab("Loading Strength") + #improve y-axis label
    theme_bw(base_size = 10) #use a black-and0white theme with set font size
```


In the **scatter matrix** we can see that the variables are approximately well divided into 3 clusters. Yes they overlap sometimes, but not substantionally. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
plot(fa)
```

In the resulting residual matrix, we see that the non-diagonal values are close to zero.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
unclass(fa$residual)[1:16, 17:31]
```

**Obervations represented in the new (tranformed) system.**


From our knowledge we can be pretty confident in the results. When we compare Bruno Fernandes and J.Kimmich we can see that the values correspond to what we'd expect. The first one is offensive player who scores goals, assits and could be labelled as attacking playmaker who creates a lot of chanes. The latter is more defensive player. He scores higher in defense and lower in offensive abilities. They share similar physicality, which is again accurately displayed in the new system. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
fifa.fa <- as_tibble(fa$scores)
fifa.fa <-
    cbind(data %>% filter(BestPos %in% c("CM/CAM/CDM", "CF/ST"))
          %>% na.omit() %>% dplyr::select(Name, BestPos),
          fifa.fa)

names(fifa.fa) <- c("Name", "Pos", "Off", "Def", "Phys")
head(fifa.fa)
```

We can visualize aggregated comparison of values for both positions. We use median because the average can be inflated by few players who have high overall ratings.  


Reminder:  


* "CF/ST" - Attacker, Central forward, Striker  
* "CM/CAM/CDM" - Central Attacking/Defensive (or hybrid) Midfielder  

Again, the plot is meaningful. Midflieders score reasonably higher than attackers. On the contrary, attackers tend to be "tougher" as they "fight" with very strong and high defenders. Midfielders are less strong but are more agile and have better stamina. They can cover bigger area and thus are better at defending.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Summarizing comparison - Barplot
# Note that we don't have to standardize the data again.
fifa.fa %>% 
    dplyr::group_by(Pos) %>%
    dplyr::summarize(Off = median(Off),
                     Def = median(Def),
                     Phys = median(Phys)) %>%
    arrange(desc(Off)) %>%
    pivot_longer(-Pos) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value, fill = Pos)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    labs(x="Factor", y="Scores") 
```

***
# 2. LDA
## 2.1. LDA on FA transformed columns  

In the next step we will apply LDA on FA tranformed dataset.  
```{r, include=FALSE}
# Useful libs
library(caret)
library(ROCR)
```

Data could look more normal, but it isn't bad either.  
The reason for the distribution in Def is that we have midfielders who are similar in this facotor to the attackers (score really low in defense). Than there are midfielders/attackers like Roberto Firmino, who have great defending as they're useful for quickly regaining control high up the pitch after loosing posession.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Data look approximatively normal
fifa.fa %>%
    dplyr::select(-Name) %>%
    pivot_longer(-Pos, names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Value") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Value, y = ..density.., color = Variable)) +
    geom_histogram(position = "identity",
                   fill = "azure2",
                   alpha = 1) +
    geom_density(alpha = 1, ) +
    facet_grid(Variable ~ .) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Spectral")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Throw out the Name col
fifa.fa <-
    fifa.fa %>% dplyr::select(-Name) %>% mutate(Pos = factor(Pos, levels =
                                                                 c("CF/ST", "CM/CAM/CDM")))

# 3. Which method is better?

To this point, we produced two LDA classifications. One for FA transformed data and one for not transformed data. From results it seems that the latter performs better. But still, we should verify wheter it does.  

We will create 100 runs of both classifications, get AUC and compare these two with t-test.

## 3.1. FA transformed LDA classification - 100 runs

```{r}
# seed

# Conclusion

We can tell that both models perform exceptionally well when making predictions.
The model with FA transformed data is worse that the one not transformed with FA. However the difference is very small and both models are pretty good.
The difference shows us that the LDA transformation of original data is more effective than combination of FA and LDA.
The reason for this is that LDA already has the trait that it finds transformation which can distinguish the target variable's values the best based on the data provided. 


The main purpose was to illustrate different techniques for preparation and transformation of data for classification. 
We used Factor Analysis to reduce the number of columns. This technique can be useful for data analysis of the differences between different positions of players and their corresponding traits. We reduced big number only to three columns with good effectivity. Note that it sometimes requires previous knowledge about the subject to determine number of columns to be obtained. Otherwise, we can use PCA for this purpose. If were to expand this analysis, we could use the FA transformed data and show which attributes make for good player on different positions.

Next we showed that LDA tranformation is very useful tool to further distinguish between the different abilities of players playing on different positions. However, it would be hard to interpret the results of LDA transformation because it returns only one column. Yes, we could tell why some players are better suited for the position than others but without much insight. On the other hand, LDA is better suited for classification and if there was the need to classify player's positions based on diffrent attributes, LDA is the technique that should be considered.
