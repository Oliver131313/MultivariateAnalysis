In a data set  \textit{DistrictsCR.RData} there are some economic and demographic indicators of all districts in the Czech Republic. 
By means of the CanCor analyze association between ekonomic (variables 1 - 7) and  demographic indicators (variables 8 - 15). \\[1ex]

\tb a) Find the total redundancy for the left set of variables (resp. right set of variables.) 
In other words: What proportion of the left set variance of original variables can be explained by "right"  canonical variables?\\

b) Test their significance by $\chi^2$ Bartlett test (with successive roots removed).\\
This p - values are not available in a packag CCA, for that reason another package CCP has to be installed and loaded.\\
